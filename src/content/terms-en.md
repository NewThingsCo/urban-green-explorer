## Terms of Use of the Urban Green Explorer web application

The following are the terms of use between you and Forum Virium Helsinki (later: “FVH”), New Things Co (later: “NTC”) and the Urban Green Explorer web application (later “UGE”, “App” or “service”). By accessing, browsing, or using this service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this service.

FVH or NTC may, without notice to you, at any time revise these Terms of Use and any other information contained in this service. Information on this service is not promised or guaranteed to be correct, current, or complete, and this site may contain inaccuracies or errors. FVH and NTC assume no responsibility (and expressly disclaims responsibility) for updating this service to keep information current or to ensure the accuracy or completeness of any posted information.

The authenticity, invariability and updatedness cannot be guaranteed in all situations. FVH and NTC assume no responsibility for any harm that may have been caused by visiting the various locations listed in the UGE service or using any material found on the physical sites featured in the App.

## Immaterial rights, copyrights

As a rule, FVH has the copyright for all content on the service. UGE and all content within it may not be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, distributed, or used for the creation of derivative works without prior written consent from FVH.

## Confidential information

### Feedback form

NTC collects voluntary feedback from the info page, which may contain your name and email should you choose to disclose this information as those fields are optional. Please note that any information or material sent to NTC through the App will be deemed not to be confidential and may be forwarded to FVH, unless otherwise stated in the feedback message.

By sending any information or material through the App, you grant FVH and NTC an unrestricted, irrevocable license to copy, reproduce, publish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, publicly display, perform, modify, create derivative works from, and otherwise freely use, those materials or information. You also agree that FVH and NTC are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques that you send them for any purpose. Personally-identifiable information that you submit through the feedback form will be handled in accordance with our privacy policy. We comply with EU General Data Processing Regulations for data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union. We also comply with all applicable EU and local regulations.

### Location data

Individual location pages in UGE are tasked to determine your current location and measure the distance from you to the target location. When close enough, the check-in button becomes enabled and you can press it to unlock more information about the target location.

As a user, you can opt out of giving the App your location and enable the check-in button by default. This decision will persist throughout your session, but you can always enable the location again from your browser’s settings should you choose to do so at a later date. The location data received at each separate location is not shared or stored anywhere other than in the App’s memory for the time being of the distance measurement process.

The map view also contains a locator icon, which will ask for your current location to be able to pinpoint you on the map. The use of this feature is optional and the user can deny access when prompted to locate the device on the map. The location information gathered by the map is not shared or stored anywhere outside the App other than for the purposes of showing the device’s location on the map in real-time.

### Netlify Analytics

The App uses Netlify Analytics to measure how many visitors use the service. Netlify gives FVH and NTC access to pageviews, how many unique visitors have visited the service, top locations by country, top pages visited and bandwidth used. Netlify Analytics is GDPR compliant.

## Business relationships

This service may provide links or references to non-FVH and non-NTC websites and resources. FVH and NTC make no representations, warranties, or other commitments whatsoever about any external websites or third-party resources that may be referenced, accessible from, or linked to our site. A link to a non-FVH or a non-NTC website does not mean that FVH endorses the content or use of such a website or its owner. In addition, FVH and NTC are not party to or responsible for any transactions you may enter into with third parties, even if you learn of such parties (or use a link to such parties) from the UGE service. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that FVH and NTC are not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and is not responsible or liable for any content, services, products, or other materials on or available from those sites or resources.

When you access a non-FVH or non-NTC website, please understand that it is independent from both companies, and that FVH or NTC do not control the content on that website.

## Linking to this site

All links to this website must be approved in writing by FVH, except that FVH consents to links in which the link and the pages that are activated by the link do not: (a) create frames around any page on this service or use other techniques that alter in any way the visual presentation or appearance of any content within this App; (b) misrepresent your relationship with FVH; (c) imply that FVH approves or endorses you, your website, or your service or product offerings. As a further condition to being permitted to link to this site, you agree that FVH may at any time, in its sole discretion, terminate permission to link to this website. In such event, you agree to immediately remove all links to this website and to cease using any FVH trademark.

## Safety of our service, Privacy Protection

Some information described below is automatically gathered on our website. Data is not collected for commercial purposes. They are not sold or otherwise transferred to third parties by the service provider.

## Browser session data

The browser’s local storage is used to maintain a record of the locations you have visited in order to show additional content when the location has been unlocked (checked-in). The user can opt-out of this feature by denying the service access to the browser’s local storage.

## Server statistics

UGE’s current hosting plan on Netlify does not include the Log Drain service, which would give access to the server’s logs and detailed statistics not present in Netlify’s Analytics service. FVH or NTC do not have access to additional server logs apart from deployment logs when releasing a new version of the App.

## Forms and Transactions, Protection

Our pages offer a voluntary feedback form on the info page for gathering information of the App’s usage, bug reports and ideas for improving the user experience. The connection to the site is always SSL protected. The purpose of protection is to prevent others from seeing the data processed on the page.

## Availability of the service

FVH or NTC do not guarantee the availability or functionality of UGE.
