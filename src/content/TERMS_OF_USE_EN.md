These are the terms of use of the Urban Green Explorer online service (hereinafter “UGE”, “online service” or “service”), which apply between you and Forum Virium Helsingin (hereinafter: “FVH”) and New Things Co (hereinafter: “NTC”) occasionally while using this online service.

FVH or NTC may, without any notice to you at any time revise these Terms and Conditions and any other information contained in this Service. Information in this Service is not promised or guaranteed to be correct, current, or complete, and this Service may contain inaccuracies or errors. FVH and NTC assume no responsibility (and expressly disclaims any liability) for updating this Service to keep information current or to ensure the accuracy or completeness of any provided information.

The authenticity, invariability and updatedness cannot be guaranteed in all situations. FVH and NTC assume no responsibility or liability for any harm that may have been caused by visiting the various locations listed in the UGE Service or using any material found on the physical sites featured in the Service.

## Intellectual property rights

All intellectual property rights related to the service (for example copyrights, trademarks and domain names) belong to FVH, the creator of the work, or its collaborators. No information on the website may be presented, duplicated, copied, transferred, forwarded, stored, changed, distributed, published, reused, licensed, sold or otherwise used for commercial purposes without the prior written consent of copyright FVH or its collaborators. The application contains open source software, which is subject to the related license terms.

## Confidential information

### Feedback form

The Service offers a voluntary feedback form on the Info page for gathering information of the usage of the Service, bug reports and ideas for improving the user experience. You may include your name and email to the feedback, should you choose to disclose this information as the information is optional. In addition to the fields in the feedback form, Netlify stores the feedback provider's IP address and browser version. The feedback is processed by NTC. Please note that information sent to NTC via the Service may be forwarded to FVH, unless otherwise stated in the feedback message.

By sending any information or material through the Service, you grant FVH and NTC an unrestricted, irrevocable license to copy, reproduce, publish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, publicly display, perform, modify, create derivative works from, and otherwise freely use, those materials or information. You also agree that FVH and NTC are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques that you send them for any purpose. Personal data that you submit through the feedback form will be handled in accordance with the Privacy Policy. We comply with EU General Data Processing Regulations for data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union. We also comply with all applicable EU and local regulations.

### Location data

Individual location pages in UGE are tasked to determine your current location and measure the distance from you to the target location. When close enough, the check-in button becomes enabled and you can press it to unlock more information about the target location.

As a user, you can opt out of giving the Service your location and enable the check-in button by default. This decision will persist throughout your session, but you can always enable the location again from your browser’s settings should you choose to do so at a later date. The location data received at each separate location is not shared or stored anywhere other than in the Service’s memory for the duration of the distance measurement process.

The map view also contains a locator icon, which will ask for your current location to be able to pinpoint you on the map. The use of this feature is optional and you can deny access when prompted to locate the device on the map. The location information gathered by the map is not shared or stored anywhere outside the Service other than for the purposes of showing the device’s location on the map in real-time.

### Netlify Analytics

The Service uses Netlify Analytics to measure how many visitors use the service. Netlify gives FVH and NTC access to:

- pageviews;
- how many unique visitors have visited the service;
- top locations by country; and
- top pages visited and bandwidth used.

Netlify Analytics is GDPR compliant.

## Business relationships

FVH and NTC make no representations, warranties, or other commitments whatsoever about any external websites or third-party resources that may be referenced, accessible from, or linked to the Service. A link to a non-FVH or a non-NTC website does not mean that FVH or NTC endorse the content or use of such a website or its owner. In addition, FVH and NTC are not party to or responsible for any transactions you may enter into with third parties, even if you learn of such parties (or use a link to such parties) from the UGE Service.

As a further condition to being permitted to link to this site, you agree that FVH may at any time, in its sole discretion, terminate permission to link to this website.
